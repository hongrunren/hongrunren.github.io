I received my bachelor's degree from Shanxi University in 2016 and my master's degree from Civil Aviation University of China in 2020. 
After that, I will study for my PhD at Fudan University under Dr. Yangyong Zhu.

My research interests include data science and the digital economy, with a recent focus on the production, distribution and pricing of data products.
